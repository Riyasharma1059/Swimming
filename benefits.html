    Swimming is a healthy activity that can be done by most people throughout their life. It is a 
    low-impact workout that has several mental and bodily health benefits all while being a good recreational 
    activity. Swimming builds endurance, muscle strength, and cardiovascular fitness. Correspondingly, it 
    also improves weight loss while being a safer alternative of working out for someone who is injured or for 
    women who are pregnant. Swimming requires less effort than other sports, but the athletes will get the 
    results they are looking for.
    The U.S. Census Bureau reports that two and a half hours per week of aerobic physical activity such as 
    swimming can decrease the risk of chronic illnesses, and help regenerate healthy cells.Furthermore, 
    swimming is linked to better cognitive function; also lowering the risk of Type II diabetes, high blood 
    pressure, and a stroke. It can improve lung and heart strength while it tones muscles in a full body 
    workout. People can typically exercise longer in water than on land without increased effort and 
    minimal joint or muscle pain. When in the water the body undergoes less physical stress thus releasing 
    pressure from the joints.
    In addition to the physical benefits of swimming, lower stress levels and occurrences of depression and 
    anxiety are known to decrease while swimming. Swimming is a meditation sport meaning there is an increase 
    of blood flow to the brain which allows an individual to evaluate stressors more calmly. The activity 
    can help increase the memory for older aged individuals who suffer from dementia.
