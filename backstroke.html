Backstroke or back crawl is one of the four swimming styles used in competitive events regulated by FINA, and the only one of these 
styles swum on the back. This swimming style has the advantage of easy breathing, but the disadvantage of swimmers not being able to 
see where they are going. It also has a different start from the other three competition swimming styles. The swimming style is 
similar to an upside down front crawl or freestyle. Both backstroke and front crawl are long-axis strokes. In individual medley 
backstroke is the second style swum; in the medley relay it is the first style swum.
