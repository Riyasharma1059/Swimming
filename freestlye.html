Freestyle is a category of swimming competition, defined by the rules of the International Swimming Federation (FINA),
in which competitors are subject to few limited restrictions on their swimming stroke. Freestyle races are the most 
common of all swimming competitions, with distances beginning with 50 meters (50 yards) and reaching 1500 meters (1650 yards),
 also known as the mile. The term 'freestyle stroke' is sometimes used as a synonym for 'front crawl', as front crawl is 
the fastest swimming stroke. It is now the most common stroke used in freestyle competitions.
